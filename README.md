# Git DHS Recode VII
 
Currently, we have general codes for 
Do-file1: c_anc_skill ///
Do-file2: c_facdel c_hospdel c_sba ///
Do-file8: c_diarrhea_pro c_treatARI

We use R/STATA to scrape labels from RAW Data and produce a classification excel file. And consult with Sven about the classification. Theoretically, the general codes should cover all country cases. However, some countries may have missing labels that general codes may fail to capture. So, we should always go and check each country to see if the general code do work in a correct way! The general code is very efficient and convenient, but do remember to DOUBLE CHECK.

Thanks!
